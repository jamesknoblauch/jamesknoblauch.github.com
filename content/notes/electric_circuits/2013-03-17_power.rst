Definitions
============

**Power**, :math:`p`, is the rate of change of energy with respect to 
time, measured in watts (W).

**Energy**, :math:`w`, is the capcity to do work, measured in Joules (J)



Mathematical Relationship
==========================

For energy :math:`w` and time :math:`t`,

.. math::

    p = \frac{dw}{dt}


Relation to voltage and current,

.. math::

    p = \frac{dw}{dt} = \frac{dw}{dq} \cdot \frac{dq}{dt} = vi


.. math::
    
    w = \int_{t_{0}}^{t} p dt = \int_{t_{0}}^{t} vi dt



Units
======

.. math::

    1W = 1\frac{J}{s}
    


Sign Conventions
================

Passive Sign Convention
------------------------

If the current enters an element through the positive teminal, 

.. math::

    p = +vi


If the current enters through the negative terminal,

.. math::

    p = -vi


Active Sign Convention
------------------------

If the current enters an element through the positive teminal, 

.. math::

    p = -vi


If the current enters through the negative terminal,

.. math::

    p = +vi
    


Conservation
=============

Power Absorbed = -Power Supplied

The algebraic sum of power in a circuit is zero.

.. math::

    \sum{p} = 0
