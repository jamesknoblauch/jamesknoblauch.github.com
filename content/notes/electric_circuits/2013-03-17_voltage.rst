Definitions
============

**Voltage** (potential difference), :math:`v`, is a measure of the energy 
required to move a unit charge through a circuit element, measured in 
volts (V).

**Energy**, :math:`w`, is the capcity to do work, measured in Joules (J)

Mathematical Relationship
==========================

For energy :math:`w` and charge :math:`q`,

.. math::

    v = \frac{dw}{dq}


For points :math:`a` and :math:`b`,

.. math::

    v_{ba} = -v_{ab}


Units
======

.. math::

    1V = 1\frac{J}{C} = 1\frac{N \cdot m}{C}
